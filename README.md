# hello-world
first lesson of my GitHub journey.

this is the first thing or file that I type in my GitHub, is that right saying this is my hub? not sure.

GitHub is new to me, and I'm not a real professional programmer, I do program sometimes, like using matlab so simulate something, and I also using C++ and Qt to create a software to communicate with a sensor and a robot's control board. But that doesn't make me a programmer, right?

I still know little about the world of computer, especially the Internet, know nothing about it,

but I'm trying to know, and I hope it won't take me a very long time.
